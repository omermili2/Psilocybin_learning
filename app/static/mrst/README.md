# Modified risk sensitivity task

Author(s): Sam Zorowitz, Livia Qoshe

A modified version of the risk sensitive learning task ([Niv et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5498-10.2012)) developed & used by Livia Qoshe for her honor's thesis work in Niv lab. The task has improved psychometric measurement properties in simulation but may encourage heuristic decision-making in some particpants.
